It is clear from the EV literature that orthogonal measurements of EVs is recommended and it is our aim to demonstrate the concordance and utility of data acquired from different platforms that work in complementary ways. Simultaneously, the organizers are aiming to promote reporting transparency, along with standard data analysis and reporting. This study will kick-start an open ISEV Task Force standardization study, with the sponsor company data setting a benchmark for their platforms / assays.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/measuring-stick-live/EV-Reference-Material-TF/Overview/","title":"Overview","parent":"EV Reference Material TF","content":"This group aims to seek standardization in the development and use of calibration, validation, and quality control reference materials for cross-platform EV measurements. These measurement metrics include, but are not limited to: diameter distribution, concentration, epitope expression, epitope density, and refractive index. Standardization of reporting and measuring these EV metrics shall be assessed through cross-platform, inter-institutional standardization studies and discussion. These data and discussions will culminate in the generation of educational resources and literature for the field.\nCo-Chairs Joshua Welsh,\nAn Hendrix\nMembers Randy Carney,\nAndré Görgens,\nJennifer Jones,\nHakho Lee,\nJohn Nolan,\nAnna Nowocin,\nVera Tang,\nEdwin van der Pol,\nZoltan Varga,\nWyatt Vreeland,\nLili Wang,\nKen Witwer\nOutputs Welsh JA, van der Pol E, Bettin BA, Carter DRF, Hendrix A, Lenassi M, Langlois MA, Llorente A, van de Nes AS, Nieuwland R, Tang V, Wang L, Witwer KW, Jones JC., Towards defining reference materials for measuring extracellular vesicle refractive index, epitope abundance, size and concentration, J Extracell Vesicles, 2020, DOI: 10.1080/20013078.2020.1816641 [pdf pdf, [website]\nActivities Open, international single EV characterization study\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/measuring-stick-live/EV-Reference-Material-TF/Standardization-Study/","title":"Standardization Study","parent":"EV Reference Material TF","content":"The ISEV Rigor and Standardization EV Reference Materials Task Force is undertaking an open, international standardization study.
